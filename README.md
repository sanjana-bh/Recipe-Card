Interactive Recipe Card website:  
The **Interactive Recipe Card** is a visually engaging, user-friendly web application designed to enhance the cooking experience with dynamic animations and intuitive functionality. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this responsive card allows users to browse recipes in a clean, structured layout that includes key sections such as the dish title, an appetizing image, ingredient lists, step-by-step instructions, and preparation details like time and servings.  
What sets this recipe card apart is its **interactive elements**. Users can toggle ingredient visibility with a click, making it easy to focus on what’s needed. The "Start Cooking" button initiates a guided cooking mode, where each step is highlighted sequentially, ensuring users follow instructions without confusion. A smooth **animated progress bar** tracks completion, providing visual feedback as they move through the recipe.  
The design prioritizes **visual appeal and usability**. CSS animations bring the card to life—hover effects on ingredients cause them to shift and change color, while transitions ensure fluid interactions. The image zooms slightly on hover, adding a subtle but delightful touch. The layout is fully **responsive**, adapting seamlessly from desktop to mobile devices. On smaller screens, sections stack vertically for readability, and fonts adjust for optimal viewing.  
Under the hood, JavaScript powers the interactivity. Buttons toggle content visibility, step navigation updates the progress bar in real time, and event listeners ensure smooth transitions. The minimalist color scheme and consistent typography create a professional yet inviting aesthetic.  
Optional enhancements could include a **countdown timer** for cooking steps or a print-friendly layout—features that further improve utility. Whether you're a cooking novice or an experienced chef, this Interactive Recipe Card transforms static instructions into an engaging, user-centric experience, making recipe-following more intuitive and enjoyable.
